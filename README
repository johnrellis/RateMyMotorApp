Rate My Motor

An app for sharing and rating photo's of one's prized automotive possessions.

Important :
Only compatible with knox module < 2.0 which is why the modules are checked in too.

The app is hosted at http://46.137.80.237/ratemymotor  (No longer hosted!)

You can login or register.  Current users are :

john, password 1234
bryan, password 1234

The app is sitting on an amazon EC2 instance and uses mongo hq for persistance.  It is a phonegap app with the apk @ https://github.com/johnrellis/RateMyMotorApp/blob/master/android/RateMyMotor.apk.  Amazon S3 is used to store the photo data.

The server is nodejs proxied with nginx.

It has only been tested on android as my macbook is out of action but you can login, view and rate photos on your desktop browser.

I didn't get to implement all the features I wanted to due to running out of time. The app really requires social network integration. 

The app is built upon examples provided in Beginning Mobile Web Development by Richard Rodger, published by Wrox 2012. 

Performance of the app is pretty bad at the moment which is why the time line is restricted to three pictures for now.  Thumbnails probably need to be used as oppossed to loading the full images in the time line.

The app provides the following API : 

/ratemymotor/api/user/login
